# CS545_Assignments
For CS545 Machine Learning class at Portland State University, we had 3 programming assignments.<br />
Assignment 1: Implemented a 2-layer neural network to analyze and recognize handwritten numbers 0-9 (MNIST dataset)<br />
Assignment 2: Implemented Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm to classify spam (UCI ML repository spambase dataset)<br />
Assignment 3: Implemented K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means algorithms to classify 2d dataset simulated from 3 Gaussians with overlaps into groups (dataset provided in class)
